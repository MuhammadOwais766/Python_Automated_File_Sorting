let’s imagine you have a box of chocolates. Each chocolate in the box has a unique name and a unique number.

The name could be something like “Milk Chocolate”, “Dark Chocolate”, “White Chocolate”, etc. These names are like the labels in a pandas DataFrame, and you can use loc to find chocolates by their names. So, if you say box.loc["Milk Chocolate"], you will get the Milk Chocolate.

The number is like the position of the chocolate in the box. It could be the 1st chocolate, the 2nd chocolate, and so on. These numbers are like the integer-based locations in a pandas DataFrame, and you can use iloc to find chocolates by their numbers. So, if you say box.iloc[1], you will get the second chocolate in the box (because counting starts from 0).

So, in summary:

loc is label-based, which means that you have to specify the name of the rows or columns that you need to filter out.
iloc, on the other hand, is integer index-based. So here, you have to specify rows and columns by their integer index.
